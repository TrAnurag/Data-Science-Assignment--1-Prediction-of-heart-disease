Data Science Assignment -1 Prediction of heart disease
A project that predicts whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not.
Conclusions:
In this project, I utilized Machine Learning techniques to predict the occurrence of heart disease in individuals. I started by importing the data and performing exploratory data analysis using plots. Next, I preprocessed the data by generating dummy variables for categorical features and scaling the other features. I then applied four different Machine Learning algorithms, including K Neighbors Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest Classifier. For each model, I optimized the parameters to improve their performance. Ultimately, the DT model achieved the highest accuracy score of 90%.
